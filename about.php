			<h1>About A Group of Friends</h1>

			<p>
				<em>A Group of Friends</em> is a kinship on the Glamdring server for
				Lord of the Rings Online. We created it to hang out without feeling
				pressured to do certain things or behave in a certain way (except being
				nice of course).
			</p>

			<h2>Kinship Charter</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					We play our own way, at our own pace, with no pressure to join group
					events or raids.
				</li>
				<li>
					We are <em>literally</em> a group of friends - nobody owns us,
					nobody's the boss, everyone's voice matters.
				</li>
				<li>
					We treat each other as friends would: we have fun, respect boundaries,
					accept our differences, avoid drama and ensure that everyone feels
					included.
				</li>
				<li>
					We don’t need a rule book for how to behave - common sense and respect
					for our friends is what guides us.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<hr />

			<h2>How we Behave</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					While "bad words" aren't forbidden, we don’t go overboard with them,
					we don’t swear <em>at</em> people, and we never use racist or
					derogatory slurs.
				</li>
				<li>
					Politics, religion, and other sensitive topics aren’t forbidden
					either, but we always keep in mind that they can heat up fast. We keep
					it chill and back off before it can turn into an argument.
				</li>
				<li>
					The bottom line: we are guided by common sense and respect for our
					friends.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<hr />

			<h2>For those who want to contribute to the kinship</h2>

			<h3>Helping Out</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Any member is welcome to pitch in - no title needed.</li>
				<li>
					If a task already has an officer assigned, they’ll coordinate anyone
					who wants to help.
				</li>
				<li>We collaborate, so no silos!</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Officers</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Officers are "friendly helpers" and not police or order-givers.</li>
				<li>
					If the officer has a speciality (e.g., Events), their role is to
					coordinate those who want to participate or contribute.
				</li>
				<li>
					We’ll cap officers at 10 people, or one-third of the kinship
					(whichever is larger).
				</li>
				<li>
					Inactive officers will be rotated out so active members can have a
					turn.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Committee</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Instead of a single leader, we have a committee of at least three
					people with equal authority.
				</li>
				<li>
					The in-game kin leader and Discord server owners are just an admin
					functions and hold no extra authority. These roles may be rotated
					among committee members.
				</li>
				<li>
					Those with a history of hostile, selfish and/or manipulative
					behaviours are not eligible to join the committee.
				</li>
				<li>
					Committee members have sworn to uphold the charter, and deliberately
					acting against it is grounds for their dismissal from the committee.
				</li>
			</ul>
