    A Group of Friends is a kinship on the Glamdring server for Lord of the Rings Online.<br><br>
	
	We created it as a place to hang out without feeling pressured to do certain things or behave in a certain way. We function much like a group of friends in real life!

	<h2 class="header-text">What Makes Us Unique</h2>

    <ul>
	<li>We play our own way, at our own pace, with no pressure to join group events or raids.</li>
	<li>We don't have a leader - instead a committee shares the  responsibility of keeping things running.</li>
	<li>We treat each other as real friends would: we have fun, respect boundaries, accept our differences, avoid drama and ensure that everyone feels included.</li>
	<li>Everyone is welcome to chip in and contribute to the kinship.</li>
	</ul>
